# Release notes

## Version 1.3

This release builds further on the refactoring work of 
[Jakob Gruber](https://github.com/schuay). It contains fixes for 
some bugs that annoyed me.

It is probably not the most stable piece of software out there, 
especially since I am new to Android development. If you want to 
help with improving Detlef, you can find the project
on [github](https://github.com/gpodder/detlef).

I especially want to thank Jakob, who helped me a lot with this
release.
