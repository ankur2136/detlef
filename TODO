* Local add/delete refactoring: the current solution seems somewhat unwieldy, come up with a better
  concept & implement it.
* Remove all file deletions from DB methods
* Replace the player controls with MediaController
* Refactor the media player backend
* Rethink how database changes are communicated to the frontend. Firing one event per change
  is simply too expensive.
* Add bulk insertion / deletion of episodes / podcasts. Again, one-by-one handling is too expensive.
* Instead of relying on gpodder.net to parse feeds, do this locally. I'd expect this to be
  an easy but substantial speedup.
